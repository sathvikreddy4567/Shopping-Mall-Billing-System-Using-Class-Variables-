# Shopping-Mall-Billing-System-Using-Class-Variable:

This mini-project is designed to explain the concept of **class variables in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using a practical real-life example of a *Shopping Mall Billing System*.
Each customer is treated as an object with instance-specific data such as name, list of purchased items, and total bill amount. A class variable named `total_customers` is used to keep track of how many customers have been created in total.

Whenever a customer object is created, the class variable is automatically incremented, demonstrating how class variables are **shared across all objects**. This project provides a clear understanding of:

* The difference between class and instance variables
* How shared data works inside a class
* How OOP can be used to build small, real-world applications
